      "Iron Man is a superhero who wears a suit of armor. His alter ego is Tony Stark. He was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Larry Lieber for Marvel Comics in Tales of Suspense #39 in the year 1963 and appears in their comic books. He is also one of the main protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the movies and the earlier comic books, Tony Stark is a human. Outside the suit, he does not have any superpowers, however he has an enormous QI, in fact his intelligence gives to him the sufficient power instead of physycal superpowers. He made the suit himself, and nobody else can usually control it. Iron Man can fly and shoot beams from his hands using special technology called \"repulsors\" in his boots and gloves. He is not hurt by most weapons like guns and cannons. There are many versions of the Iron Man suit, because Stark keeps making improvements.In the later comic books, Stark took an experimental virus called \"STD\" which allowed him to control his suit with his mind and summon it wherever he was. Stark would eventually develop an armor that he could store in his body. This armor was known as the \"Bleeding Edge Model 37\".",

        "Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for humorous effect and running gags.The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei\" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as \"Renolds\".)Reynolds himself would eventually portray the character in the X-Men film series, appearing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel Deadpool 2 (2018). He is slated to continue playing the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
